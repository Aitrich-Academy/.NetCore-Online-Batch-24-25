                <p>Following massive job cuts, the National Weather Service is eliminating or reducing vital weather balloon launches in eight US locations. Meteorologists and former agency leaders warn this will degrade the accuracy of forecasts just as severe weather season kicks in.

                    The normally twice-daily launches of weather balloons in about 100 locations provide information that forecasters and computer models use to figure out what the weather will be and how dangerous it can get. 
                    
                    So cutting back is a mistake, said eight different scientists, meteorologists and former top officials at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - the weather service's parent agency.</p>

        <p>Senior members of Donald Trump’s cabinet have been involved in a serious security breach while discussing secret military plans for recent US attacks on the Houthi armed group in Yemen.

            In an extraordinary blunder, key figures in the Trump administration – including the vice-president, JD Vance, the defence secretary Pete Hegseth, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard – used the commercial chat app Signal to convene and discuss plans – while also including a prominent journalist in the group.
            
            Signal is not approved by the US government for sharing sensitive information.
            
            Others in the chat included the Trump adviser Stephen Miller; Trump’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles; and the key Trump envoy Steve Witkoff.</p></td>
